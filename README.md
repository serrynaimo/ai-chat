# AI Chat
A simple AI chat UI to connect to OpenAI v1 compatible API streaming endpoints. Supports markdown, code and math highlighting and uses local-storage for chat history. Careful: Can make snarky remarks.

# Getting started
Recommending LM Studio to run server APIs and `llama-3.2-3b-instruct` as a fast, ease to host model to get started with for conversations. It's configured as default in the `index.html` and with a max-length of 20000. Adjust to your preferences.
